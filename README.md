# Laser Cut Eurorack Case
*Laser cut 3u 54hp eurorack case.*

 - Cut from 6mm hardboard
 - Uses pre-drilled holes that fits many different screw sizes
 - Around 54hp wide, and 65mm deep.

The rails are built in and laser cut to accommodate M3 bolts. They're cut slightly smaller so the bolt cuts threads in the wood and holds the panel tightly. Hardboard isn't the most durable material so you're not going to want to rearrange the panels too often.
